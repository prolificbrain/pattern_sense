## Overview

PatternSense is a groundbreaking pattern recognition and cognitive processing framework built on a foundation of trinary logic. Moving beyond the limitations of binary systems, PatternSense leverages a three-state logic system (+1, 0, -1) that enables more nuanced representation of information patterns and relationships.

Developed by [Prolific Brain](https://github.com/prolificbrain), this framework represents a significant advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence, offering superior performance on complex pattern recognition tasks while requiring less training data than conventional approaches.

## Key Features

### üß† Trinary Logic Foundation

Unlike traditional binary systems, PatternSense uses a three-state logic system:
- **Positive (+1)**: Representing affirmative or activating information
- **Neutral (0)**: Representing ambiguity, uncertainty, or absence of information
- **Negative (-1)**: Representing inhibitory or contradictory information

  <img src="docs/assets/diagrams/trinary_logic.svg" alt="Trinary Logic System" width="600"/>
  <p><em>Figure 2: Trinary Logic System</em></p>
</div>

This approach enables more efficient encoding of complex patterns and improved handling of uncertainty.

### ‚ö° GPU-Accelerated Processing

PatternSense includes optimized implementations for GPU execution using PyTorch, enabling high-throughput pattern processing and recognition:

```python
from patternsense import AcceleratedPatternMemory
import torch

# Check for GPU availability
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else 
                     "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu")

# Create accelerated pattern memory
accel_memory = AcceleratedPatternMemory(
    max_patterns=10000,
    use_gpu=(device.type != 'cpu'),
    batch_size=64
)
```

### üîç Hierarchical Pattern Recognition

Process patterns at multiple levels of abstraction, enabling recognition of both fine-grained details and high-level structures:

<div align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/diagrams/hierarchical_recognition.svg" alt="Hierarchical Pattern Recognition" width="650"/>
  <p><em>Figure 3: Hierarchical Pattern Recognition Process</em></p>
</div>

```python
from patternsense import HierarchicalPatternNetwork

# Create hierarchical network
network = HierarchicalPatternNetwork(
    input_dimensions=(28, 28),  # For image data
    max_levels=3,
    patterns_per_level=1000
)

# Learn patterns hierarchically
level_indices = network.learn_pattern(image_data)
print(f"Pattern stored at indices: {level_indices}")
```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Temporal Pattern Analysis

Recognize patterns that unfold over time, crucial for sequence analysis and prediction:

```python
from patternsense import TemporalPatternMemory

# Create temporal pattern memory
temporal_memory = TemporalPatternMemory(
    max_patterns=1000,
    temporal_window=5
)

# Observe a sequence of patterns
for pattern in sequence:
    idx, matches = temporal_memory.observe_pattern(pattern)
    if matches:
        print(f"Matched with: {matches}")
```

### üö® Anomaly Detection

Detect subtle deviations from normal patterns using multiple detection methods:

```python
from patternsense import AnomalyScorer, PatternMemory, PatternClusteringEngine

# Create anomaly detector
anomaly_detector = AnomalyScorer(
    methods=['reconstruction', 'clustering', 'statistical'],
    pattern_memory=PatternMemory(max_patterns=1000),
    clustering_engine=PatternClusteringEngine(n_clusters=5)
)

# Train and detect anomalies
anomaly_detector.train(normal_patterns, abnormal_patterns)
is_anomaly, score, method_scores = anomaly_detector.is_anomaly(test_pattern)
```

# Create a pattern memory
pattern_memory = PatternMemory(max_patterns=1000)

# Learn some patterns
pattern1 = np.random.randn(10, 10)
pattern2 = np.random.randn(10, 10)

idx1 = pattern_memory.learn_pattern(pattern1)
idx2 = pattern_memory.learn_pattern(pattern2)

# Recognize a pattern
test_pattern = pattern1 + 0.1 * np.random.randn(10, 10)  # Noisy version
matches = pattern_memory.recognize_pattern(test_pattern, top_k=3)

for idx, similarity in matches:
    print(f"Pattern {idx} matched with similarity {similarity:.4f}")
