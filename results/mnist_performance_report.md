## Limitations

1. **Limited Capacity**: The network has fewer parameters than traditional deep learning models, which may limit its capacity to learn complex patterns.
2. **Slower Convergence**: The learning process is slower compared to gradient-based methods like backpropagation.
3. **Image Preprocessing**: Converting images to trinary representations leads to information loss.
4. **Scalability**: The current implementation may face scalability challenges with larger networks.
5. **Readout Mechanism**: The simple readout mechanism may not fully capture the distributed representations.

## Advantages

1. **Emergent Learning**: The network demonstrates emergent pattern recognition capabilities without explicit supervision.
2. **Biological Plausibility**: The learning mechanism is more biologically plausible than backpropagation.
3. **Local Processing**: Learning is based on local information, which is more neuromorphic.
4. **Adaptability**: The network can adapt to new patterns without catastrophic forgetting.
